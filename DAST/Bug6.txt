Bug 5: Lack of encryption over HTTP.
        •	Description: The application is accepting and processing requests over HTTP, which means that sensitive information, such as login credentials, session tokens, or personal data, may be exposed to interception during transmission
        •	Steps to Reproduce:
               1. Open the application in a browser or make a request using http:// (not https://).
               2. Send a request to any endpoint that involves sensitive data, such as login or user profile submission.
               3. Use a tool like Wireshark or mitmproxy to intercept and view the request in plaintext, showing that sensitive information is being transmitted over an unencrypted channel.        •	Expected Result: The app should include a unique anti-CSRF token in all forms and verify it on the server before processing the request.
        •	Actual Result: Data loss, Man in the middle attack
        •	Severity: High
        •	Risk Score: 8/10 (High, as it is essential protect the data)
        •	Suggested Fix: Ensure your SSL/TLS configuration follows best practices
